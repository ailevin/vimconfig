This is a major update to the vim configuration on X1 laptop
My vim startup file is ~/.vmrc and the rest is in ~.vim
The plugins are loaded by plug.vim and plug.vim is installed
automatically by .vimrc.  In fact, .vimrc will create ~/.vim
if necessary as well as minimum necessary subdirectories.
This is much simpler then my old installation

"" INSTALLATION

These steps will create a .vim directory and populate it.
  1.  Make sure git and vim are installed and go to home directory
  2.  $git clone TBD to clone .vimrc file into home directory
  3.  $vim
  4.  You may get error message due to colorscheme missing
  5.  within vim :PlugInstall

"" UPDATE

plug.vim will manage plugin updates
