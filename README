This is my initial vim configuration on X1 laptop
My vim startup file is .vim/vmrc, so everything is contained in .vim
The plugins in .vim/pack/bundle/start are saved as submodules
I am configuring this in github.com/ailevin/vimconfig.

These steps will create a .vim directory and populate it.
  1.  Make sure git is installed and go to directory where you want .vim

  3.  $cd .vim
  4.  $sudo mkdir undo swap backup
  5.  $sudo chmod 777 undo swap backup
